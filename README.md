# UniCircleDifficulty
UniCircleDifficulty is a collection of experimental systems to replace various outdated systems in osu!

This project is in early stages and is primarily for testing concepts that are too experimental to propose as changes to the current osu! development repositories

## Projects

- **UniCircle.Difficulty** is a framework for building difficulty calculators for osu! rulesets
- **UniCircle.Difficulty.Standard** is an osu!standard difficulty calculator built with the UniCircle.Difficulty framework
- **UniCircle.Visualiser** is a WPF app that is used to visualise the calculations being made in the standard difficulty calculator
- **UniCircle.Score** is an experimental difficulty-aware score processor
